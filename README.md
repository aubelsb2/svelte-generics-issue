This is for a coule of idea issues:

# Issue 1: `$$Generic` isn't supported


![img_1.png](img_1.png)

It should be used to set the type on the slot here:

![img_3.png](img_3.png)

I expect it to be `string`

# Issue 2: `$$Slots`

![img.png](img.png)

This seems partially supported, since I have a matching 
slot definition below this should be considered in use.

# Issue 3: Default import paths

Default import path on a brand new project generated using the "getting started guide" is "wrong".
